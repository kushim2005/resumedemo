        <p><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i></p>
        
        <p><b>Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary academic field<sup>[1]</sup> that uses statistics, <mark>scientific computing</mark>, <del>scientific methods</del>, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.<br>[2]
Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4</p>
<p>Data science is "a concept to unify satatistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" to a"understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[5] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.[6] However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[7][</p>
